#### The Developer Guidelines are like a railing that helps you to prevent falls in the precipice. Imagine that you walk by the precipice and you made wrong step, if don't have a railing you will fall in the precipice, but if have a railing you can catch and still walk. Here have a stable railing to help us to walk save, namely write clean, readable, and maintainable code.

# Introduction

The objective of this document is to outline a set of language-level programming conventions and development guidelines to aid developers in writing high quality code using a consistent set of idioms. The patterns and practices that are discussed in this document are a result of years of education, research, and industry experience by qualified software engineers around the world. These guidelines cover how to write readable and well organized code, but should not be confused with software design, which focuses more on implementing well written solutions to a specific problem.
To use the conventions effectively there will be sections describing each idiom followed by a set of guidelines. The guidelines used are the same ones used in Framework Design Guidelines by Microsoft and are:
•	DO: Do follow this guideline and don’t stray from it
•	DO NOT: Do not violate this guideline
•	AVOID: Avoid a situation at all costs unless there is no other alternative
•	CONSIDER: Consider this guideline and use it when possible, but otherwise it is not strictly necessaary
CONSIDER: This document’s conventions and guidelines are only as effective as its adoption rate by developers.
CONSIDER: It is highly recommended that you use this developer document in conjunction with the official Framework Design Guidelines, Conventions, Idioms, and Patterns for Reusable .NET libraries, and Code Complete 2, A practical handbook of software construction, both of which are high quality resources for engineering great software.
