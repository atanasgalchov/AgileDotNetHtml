## Introduction

I believe that HtmlAgilityPack is a great library for working whit HTML in C#, but here is a good alternative. Agile Dot Net Html is a library that gives features as parsing and building HTML. Agile Dot Net Html allow you convert HTML to C# objects represent this HTML and Build these object to HTML string again. There is a rich set of C# object which represent HTML elements and their attributes by w3 school HTML 5 standard. The idea of this project is to give you a good alternative on HtmlAgilityPack and allow you fast and easy create/ edit composite HTML structures.
