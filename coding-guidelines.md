# Introduction

The Developer Guidelines are like a railing that helps you to prevent falls in the precipice. Imagine that you walk by the precipice and you made wrong step, if don't have a railing you will fall in the precipice, but if have a railing you can catch and still walk. Here have a stable railing to help us to walk save, namely write clean, readable, and maintainable code.
The objective of this document is to outline a set of language-level programming conventions and development guidelines to add developers to writing high-quality code. The rules below are some of the best practices approved by a lot of experienced developers. Choosing these rules is a result of years of education and professional experience with software development. Keeping the rules below is a warranty for write-on readable and easy maintenance code, and warranty to avoid confusion in the future.
These guidelines used are the same ones in Framework Design Guideline by Microsoft and are:

* ✔️ DO: Do follow this guideline and don’t stray from it
* ❌ DO NOT: Do not violate this guideline
* ⁉️  AVOID a situation at all costs unless there is no other alternative
* ❓ CONSIDER: Consider this guideline and use it when possible, but otherwise it is not strictly necessaary
CONSIDER: This document’s conventions and guidelines are only as effective as its adoption rate by developers.
CONSIDER: It is highly recommended that you use this developer document in conjunction with the official Framework Design Guidelines, Conventions, Idioms, and Patterns for Reusable .NET libraries, and Code Complete 2, A practical handbook of software construction, both of which are high quality resources for engineering great software.
