#### The Developer Guidelines are like a railing that helps you to prevent falls in the precipice. Imagine that you walk by the precipice and you made wrong step, if don't have a railing you will fall in the precipice, but if have a railing you can catch and still walk. Here have a stable railing to help us to walk save, namely write clean, readable, and maintainable code.

# Introduction

The objective of this document is to outline a set of language-level programing conventions and development guidelines to add developers in writing hight quality code.The patterns below are ones of the best practices approved from lot of expiriaced developers.Chosing of this patternt is result of years education and profesional expiriance with software development.Keeping the ruls below is wrantly for write on readable and easy maintenanbale code, and warantly to avoid confusing in the future.
This guidelines used are the same ones in Frameword Design Guideline by Microsoft and are:

* DO: Do follow this guideline and don’t stray from it
* DO NOT: Do not violate this guideline
* AVOID: Avoid a situation at all costs unless there is no other alternative
* CONSIDER: Consider this guideline and use it when possible, but otherwise it is not strictly necessaary
CONSIDER: This document’s conventions and guidelines are only as effective as its adoption rate by developers.
CONSIDER: It is highly recommended that you use this developer document in conjunction with the official Framework Design Guidelines, Conventions, Idioms, and Patterns for Reusable .NET libraries, and Code Complete 2, A practical handbook of software construction, both of which are high quality resources for engineering great software.
